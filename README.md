# GlobeTravels Website

This is my first HTML project for Assignment 1.

## Project Details
- Project Name: GlobeTrEK
- College: KIET
- Student: SHREYANSH PRAJAPATI

## What I Learned
I learned how to write a basic HTML5 page using headings, paragraphs, tables, images, and links.

## Features in my Website
- Headings `<h1>, <h2>` etc.
- Paragraphs with **bold**, *italic*, underline, and strike
- Images of travel places
- A table with travel packages
- Lists (ordered, unordered, definition)
- Hyperlinks (internal, external, homepage link)
- Simple navigation bar with table
- Web page end with copyright

## How to Run
1. Download the folder from GitHub.
2. Open the file `div.html` in any browser (like Chrome).
3. Make sure the `images` folder is in the same location as the html file, so pictures will show.

## Output
The website shows travel destinations, packages, and contact information.  
This project is only made with basic HTML tags, no CSS or Javascript.
